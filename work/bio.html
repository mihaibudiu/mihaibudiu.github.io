            <P>During the years I have participated in the design and
              construction of several complex software artifacts.  I
              like building systems based on strong theoretical
              foundations.

            <P>My research has spanned several broad areas of computer science:
              <ul>
                <li>Databases
                <li>Software-defined networking and <a href="https://p4.org">P4</a>
                <li>Cloud computing infrastructure: distributed computation
                  platforms, monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis
                  of large scale clusters
